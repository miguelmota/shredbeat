## Supported platforms

Supports Mac OS X and Linux.

Works with [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/), [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com), [Hype Machine](http://hypem.com/), [Mixcloud](https://www.mixcloud.com/), and [Fanburst](https://fanburst.com/) playlist urls.

## How it works

Shredbeat listens to system wide [global keypress](https://github.com/miguelmota/global-keypress) events to determine how fast you're typing. The faster you type, the faster and louder the music will play.
